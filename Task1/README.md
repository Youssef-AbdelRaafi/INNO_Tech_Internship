# Task 1 - INNOTEC Internship

This task focuses on **basic frontend development** and **introductory algorithm analysis**.  
It contains three main parts, each with a specific goal and required technologies or logic.

---

## 🧩 1. Student Affairs System – UI Development

- Develop a **multi-page interface** (around 4 to 5 pages) using:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Bootstrap
- All styles must be written using **inline styles only**.
- The system simulates a basic student affairs dashboard or application.

---

## 🧮 2. Sum of Numbers from 1 to N

- Write code to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N using:
  - A mathematical **formula**
  - A **for loop**
- Compare both methods by checking **CPU usage** or execution time.
- Add **validations using variables** to handle incorrect or edge-case inputs.

---

## 🔢 3. Print Numbers from 1 to N

- Print numbers from 1 to N using a loop.
- Ensure there is **no trailing comma** in the output.
  - Example: `1, 2, 3` ✅ — not `1, 2, 3,` ❌
- Calculate the **time complexity** of the initial implementation.
- Identify whether the code uses the **string builder pattern**, and explain how this approach improves performance in some cases.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build clean, structured HTML pages using only inline styling.
- Practice comparing performance between logic-based and mathematical approaches.
- Learn how to construct efficient and clean string outputs with complexity analysis.
